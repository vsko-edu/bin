CSV Conversion Utilities.
By LoranceStinson+csv@gmail.com
Based on my AWK CSV parsing function.
See http://lorance.freeshell.org/csvutils/ for information

These are utilities for converting CSV files to different formats. Included are:
    csv2csv   - Converts between different formats of CSV. Can also rearrange 
                columns and perform other changes.
    csv2html  - Converts to HTML with a high level of flexibility.
    csv2sc    - Converts to the format used by the sc spreadsheet calculator.
                This is VERY experimental and should be used with caution.
    csv2sql   - Converts to basic SQL.

Backslashes:
    These are all shell scripts that call an embedded AWK script. This makes it
    very important that the backslash character be properly escaped when passed
    on the command line. If you do not get the results you expected with a
    backslash character try doubling what you have.

Defaults:
    Someone asked in Usenet about default values for the escape, quote and
    separator characters. I have changed the scripts to use the value of the
    environment variables CSV_ESCAPE, CSV_QUOTE and CSV_SEPARATOR respectively
    as the default if they are set. This will change the default value for
    reading and writing CSV files along with the help text.

Note on Mawk:
    There seems to be a bug in Mawk with regards to backslash characters. The
    function gsub is used to escape special characters, like the quote and
    escape characters. When the escape character is a backslash and Mawk is
    used only one backslash is output instead of the required two. The hidden
    command line option -z will correct for this. Only use -z if you are using
    Mawk, it will cause other AWKs to output three backslash characters.
    Setting the environment variable CSV_MAWK_BUG to a true value will do the
    same thing.
